Hi, I’m @delapsus, curmudgeon at large, recently retired from a career in RDBMS database engineering.

My particular specialties are RDBMS databases (currently working with mysql), efficient data storage and transmittal, data encryption / encrypted data handling, and time/date issues.

I’m fairly well experienced in C/C++, PHP, javascript, SQL stored procedures, and bash scripting. I have some exposure to Python but no one would call me an expert at it.

I've worked as a programmer since back when Fortran, LisP, and various assembly languages were useful job skills, and 16-bit integers were standard.
